    "# Homework: The Dawn of Neural Machine Translation with Seq2Seq\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Historical Context and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the rise of deep learning, machine translation (MT) was dominated by **Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)**. SMT systems were complex engineering feats, relying on statistical models to translate phrases piece-by-piece and then reassembling them using intricate rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, a seminal paper changed the landscape: **\"Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\"** by Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le. They proposed an elegant, end-to-end neural architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is remarkably simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Encoder**: An RNN reads the input sentence (e.g., English) one word at a time, compressing the entire meaning into a single, fixed-size vector. This is often called the **context vector** or, more poetically, a **\"thought vector.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Decoder**: Another RNN takes this \"thought vector\" as its starting point and generates the output sentence (e.g., French) one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture marked the beginning of **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**. In 2016, Google Translate switched from its older SMT system to NMT. The improvement was dramatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"With this update, Google Translate is improving more in a single leap than we've seen in the last ten years combined.\"** – [Google Blog, 2016 ](https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original 2014 paper used LSTMs. However, we will use **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** for this assignment just to mix it up! GRUs are similar to LSTMs in that they use gates to control information flow, but their architecture is simpler (two gates vs. three, and no separate cell state). They often perform similarly to LSTMs but are slightly faster to train and easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)\n",
    "\n",
    "When training RNNs, we must backpropagate gradients through all time steps of the sequence. This is called **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**. The gradients flow backwards through the unrolled RNN, allowing the model to learn long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 BPTT and Truncated BPTT (TBPTT)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a sequence is very long (e.g., modeling an entire document), full BPTT consumes excessive memory because we must store the activations for every time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Truncated BPTT (TBPTT)** solves this by breaking the sequence into chunks. We process a chunk, backpropagate gradients only within that chunk, and then pass the hidden state forward to the next chunk, stopping the gradient flow at the chunk boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, our sentences are short, so we will use standard BPTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The \"Reversal Trick\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2014 paper discovered a surprising trick that significantly boosted performance: **Reverse the source sentence.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original**: [I, love, AI] → [J'aime, l'IA]\n",
    "- **Reversed**: [AI, love, I] → [J'aime, l'IA]\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, the first words of the output (J'aime) are very close to the corresponding words in the reversed input (I). This creates short-term dependencies, making it much easier for the optimizer to \"establish communication\" between the input and the output early in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Teacher Forcing\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the decoder, if we use the model's prediction as the input for the subsequent step, an early mistake can cascade, making training unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teacher Forcing** is a strategy where we sometimes use the actual ground truth token from the training data as the input for the next step, rather than the model's own prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Setup and Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a dataset of English-French sentence pairs.\n",

    "### 6.2 Understanding Your Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, you may notice that your translations are not perfect - and that's completely normal! Here's what you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Good Results Look Like:**\n",
    "- Training loss decreasing from ~5.0 to ~1.0-1.5\n",
    "- Validation loss around 2.5-3.5\n",
    "- Some simple phrases translating correctly (e.g., \"how are you\" → \"comment vas tu\")\n",
    "- Shorter sentences working better than longer ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Translations May Be Poor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Information Bottleneck**: This is the fundamental limitation we've been discussing. The entire English sentence must be compressed into a single fixed-size vector (512 numbers). For complex sentences, critical information gets lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insufficient Training**: 30 epochs on this small dataset is barely enough. Production NMT systems train for much longer on millions of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting**: If your validation loss is significantly higher than training loss (e.g., 2.8 vs 1.3), the model is memorizing training patterns rather than learning to translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common Phrase Bias**: The model often outputs frequent French phrases (like \"je suis...\") regardless of the actual input, because these patterns were common in training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Greedy Decoding**: We always pick the highest probability word. Beam search (which considers multiple possibilities) would improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Your Model Is Actually Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at a translation like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"i am cold\" → \"je suis serieux\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model correctly learned:\n",
    "- \"i am\" → \"je suis\" ✓\n",
    "- But outputs a common word \"serieux\" instead of \"froid\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the model IS learning French grammar and common patterns, just not the specific vocabulary mapping yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Is Why Attention Was Invented!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor performance of vanilla Seq2Seq on longer sentences directly motivated the invention of attention mechanisms (covered in the next module). Attention allows the decoder to \"look back\" at different parts of the input instead of relying on a single compressed vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions in a separate text cell or document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Information Bottleneck**: The core limitation of this architecture is that the encoder must compress the entire input sentence into a single fixed-size context vector (hidden). Why is this a significant problem when translating very long or complex sentences?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Reversal**: Explain again, in your own words, why reversing the input (the \"Reversal Trick\") helped the model learn more effectively. Relate your answer to the concept of gradient flow in BPTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TBPTT Application**: While we used standard BPTT here, describe a different NLP task where Truncated BPTT (TBPTT) would be essential, and explain why standard BPTT would be unsuitable in that scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Packing**: Why is it important to use `pack_padded_sequence` in the encoder when dealing with batched inputs? What might happen if we didn't use it?\n"

    "### 6.2 Understanding Your Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, you may notice that your translations are not perfect - and that's completely normal! Here's what you should expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Good Results Look Like:**\n",
    "- Training loss decreasing from ~5.0 to ~1.0-1.5\n",
    "- Validation loss around 2.5-3.5\n",
    "- Some simple phrases translating correctly (e.g., \"how are you\" → \"comment vas tu\")\n",
    "- Shorter sentences working better than longer ones\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Translations May Be Poor:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Information Bottleneck**: This is the fundamental limitation we've been discussing. The entire English sentence must be compressed into a single fixed-size vector (512 numbers). For complex sentences, critical information gets lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insufficient Training**: 30 epochs on this small dataset is barely enough. Production NMT systems train for much longer on millions of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting**: If your validation loss is significantly higher than training loss (e.g., 2.8 vs 1.3), the model is memorizing training patterns rather than learning to translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common Phrase Bias**: The model often outputs frequent French phrases (like \"je suis...\") regardless of the actual input, because these patterns were common in training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Greedy Decoding**: We always pick the highest probability word. Beam search (which considers multiple possibilities) would improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Your Model Is Actually Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at a translation like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"i am cold\" → \"je suis serieux\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model correctly learned:\n",
    "- \"i am\" → \"je suis\" ✓\n",
    "- But outputs a common word \"serieux\" instead of \"froid\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the model IS learning French grammar and common patterns, just not the specific vocabulary mapping yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Is Why Attention Was Invented!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor performance of vanilla Seq2Seq on longer sentences directly motivated the invention of attention mechanisms (covered in the next module). Attention allows the decoder to \"look back\" at different parts of the input instead of relying on a single compressed vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Bonus: Diagnostic Function (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand what your model has learned, implement this diagnostic function that checks if the model can at least memorize some training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        predicted_words = set(fr_predicted)\n",
    "        overlap = expected_words.intersection(predicted_words)\n",
    "        if len(expected_words) > 0:\n",
    "            accuracy = len(overlap) / len(expected_words) * 100\n",
    "            print(f\"  Word overlap:   {len(overlap)}/{len(expected_words)} ({accuracy:.1f}%)\")\n",

    "# Run after loading best model\n",

    "### 6.4 Conceptual Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions in a separate text cell or document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Information Bottleneck**: The core limitation of this architecture is that the encoder must compress the entire input sentence into a single fixed-size context vector (hidden). Why is this a significant problem when translating very long or complex sentences?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Reversal**: Explain again, in your own words, why reversing the input (the \"Reversal Trick\") helped the model learn more effectively. Relate your answer to the concept of gradient flow in BPTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TBPTT Application**: While we used standard BPTT here, describe a different NLP task where Truncated BPTT (TBPTT) would be essential, and explain why standard BPTT would be unsuitable in that scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Packing**: Why is it important to use `pack_padded_sequence` in the encoder when dealing with batched inputs? What might happen if we didn't use it?"
